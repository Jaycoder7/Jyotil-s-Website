  I have made many projects over my high school journey. These are the highlights of my projects! I made 2 engineering 
  projects and many other coding projects. I am currently working on a third engineering project.

        The Sun Tracking solar panel was my project in 10th grade. The project used First Robotics Competition(FRC) components to track the sun. This proved to be a 
        limitation but we were able to navigate this challenge and get the panel to sucessfully track the sun. The original efficency of the panel was 7% and with our added 
        technology the panel was 11%. This project really motivated me to continue engineering and got me interested in photovoltic technology and electrical work.

        The lunar rover was my project junior year. I made this project along many teamates and this project really allowed me to combine all my skills into one project.   
        This rover had both electrical and pneumatic components. This rover had vision tracking and was all coded in C++. My contribution was coding the whole rover, doing 
        the electrical and pneumatics, and working with my sub-group of the sun tracking solar panel. The space rover had 4 components: 
        1. Rocker Bogie chassis. This design helps the rover travel over rough terrain. The design makes it easy to go over rocks, mountains, and other rough surfaces. 
        2. Sun Tracking solar panel. This was the part that I worked on the most. Our team was split into 4 sub departments based on these features and I was part of the    
        sun-tracking solar panel team. This is a continuation of my project from last year which follows the sun through out the day to maximize the efficiency design of    
        the solar panel.
        3. Collection Arm. The arm is used to scoop up samples from the terrain. The arm is a major feature for the rover because it helps bring samples from different     
        planets back to earth. 4. Collection Tray. The collection tray is used to store all the samples that the rover will collect. Here is a video of project in motion: https://youtu.be/QVWDXtHo5mw

        Another project I did is make websites for my internship. I made 4 websites total. 2 are one page redirects to zoom links with some information. The other 2 are the         main website they currently use and the development website used for testing and running the website. This experience helped me learn a lot and expanded my                  knowledge a lot. I learned to build websites and how to manage websites.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        Thatâ€™s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
