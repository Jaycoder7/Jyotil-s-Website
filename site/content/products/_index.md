        The Sun Tracking solar panel was my project in 10th grade. The project used First Robotics Competition(FRC) components to track the sun. This proved to be a limitation but we were able to navigate this challenge and get the panel to sucessfully track the sun. The original efficency of the panel was 7% and with our added technology the panel was 11%. This project really motivated me to continue engineering and got me interested in photovoltic technology and electrical work.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
